## About the Field:
Road-side lights on-off using motion sensors for low crowded roads and at places where solar energy is not available or affoardable.

## Problems Nowadays:
The light in road-side are always on which consumes too much energy and even though we can use solar technology, it is very expensive. So, a more effective solution is needed to save energy and money.

## Solution:
Here we can use motion sensor/detector at the bottom of every road-side light stand, so, when a vehicle or any object passes it it gives signal to the next light stand and it glows up automatically giving light and the previous light shuts down automatically.

## Competitive Advantage:
It will be cheaper and more efficient and will save money compared to normal switched lights or solar lights. We can also combine solar technology with this to completely negate energy consumption.
